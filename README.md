# Quests
Quests is an Android application for creating flexible to-do lists with the goal
of providing a simple task management solution that is more usable than writing
down tasks in a text document or on a sheet of paper.

Quests should be usable entirely offline; the only capability that
requires a connection to the Internet is a backup feature with a remote database.
